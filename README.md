# MyToken

This Solidity smart contract represents a basic token contract named "MyToken." It includes functionality for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens, as well as public variables to store information about the token.

## Description

The contract includes the following features:

- Public variables:
  - `tokenname`: A string representing the name of the token ("META" in this case).
  - `tokenabbrv`: A string representing the token's abbreviation ("MTA" in this case).
  - `totalsupply`: A uint representing the total supply of the token, initialized to 0.

- Mapping variable:
  - `balances`: A mapping that associates addresses with token balances.

- Mint function:
  - `mint(address _address, uint _value)`: Increases the total supply and the balance of a specific address by a specified value.

- Burn function:
  - `burn(address _address, uint _value)`: Decreases the total supply and the balance of a specific address by a specified value, but only if the address has sufficient balance.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with this contract, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., `MyToken.sol`).
3. Copy and paste the provided code into the file.
4. Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.24" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
5. Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
